# Movie-Search-App
This project is a simple Android app. I can connect to a web api similar to imdb and return relevant information to the user based on a desired movie they wish to search. The JSON string is parsed and the information is displayed to the user to peruse. This information is also stored in a local SQLite database. The user can look through their movie search history to find previous searches. Alternativley if the movie is searched again, and is already contained in the database a web call will not be initiated but instead will return the information from the stored database.
